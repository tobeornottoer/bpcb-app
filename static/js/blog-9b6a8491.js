Printed circuit board technology has been evolving to meet the demands of smaller and faster products.HDI boards are more compact and feature smaller vias, pads, copper traces, and spaces. As a result, HDI allows for denser routing, making the PCB lighter, more compact, and with fewer layers. A single HDI board can accommodate the functionalities of multiple boards previously used in a device. HDI PCBs are a preferred choice for high-layer and expensive laminated boards",date:"May 22, 2024",path:"/what_is_hdi_pcb"},{title:"Aluminum PCB Stackup",poster:"/introduce/statics/1728371983538.png",description:"Among all MCPCBs,aluminum PCB is one of the most common types.The base material of an aluminum-based PCB consists of an aluminum core and standard FR4,which offers efficient heat dissipation and cools electronic components,thereby improving the overall performance of the product.",date:"May 22, 2024",path:"/aluminum_pcb_stackup"},{title:"What is Flexible PCB",poster:"/introduce/statics/1036458810617.jpg",description:"Flexible circuits (also variously referred to around the globe as flex circuits, flexible printed circuit boards, flex print, Flexi-circuits) are members of electronic and interconnection family. They consist of a thin insulating polymer film having conductive circuit patterns affixed thereto and typically supplied with a thin polymer coating to protect the conductor circuits. The technology has been used for interconnecting electronic devices since the 1950s in one form or another. It is now one of the most important interconnection technologies in use for the manufacture of many of today's most advanced electronic products.",date:"May 22, 2024",path:"/flexible_pcb"},{title:"What is a Rigid-Flex PCB",poster:"/introduce/statics/2359519684258.png",description:"Rigid-Flex printed circuit boards are boards using a combination of flexible and rigid board technologies in an application.
